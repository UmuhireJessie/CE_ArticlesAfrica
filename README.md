This a project about Circular ecomomy with the purpose of showing countries and the articles
available that talked about the Circular Economy.

## Generating the Map
To generate the map we have used three(3) mainly packages that helped in building the map. Each of the package 
has its own capabilities as it is explaine below:

- Geopandas: geoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. 
This is a package that provided us with leverages of the map of africa with its countries, which came handy 
while plotting the number of articles for the African countries we had in the dataset.

- Plotly: plotly is a technical computing company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, that develops online data
analytics and visualization tools. Plotly provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for individuals
and collaboration, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python.

- Pandas: Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine
learning tasks.
